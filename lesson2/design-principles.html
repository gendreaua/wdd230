            <p class="principles">Fitt's indicates that the efficiency of moving from one point to
                another on the screen. So if there is an eye-catching image or logo that 
                is leading to the end result of a user clicking a button, how easy is it
                for the user to go from where they are looking to that button. This law 
                also includes how easy it is or how far apart various poppular buttons or
                links are to make the site more user-friendly. <br><br>
                The library site has all of the important links near each other at the top. 
                The login button is the first thing a person sees because it is bigger and 
                eye-catching to make it easy for users to get to their library accounts. In 
                close proximity to this button is the search link to find new titles and the 
                location link to find the library near you. There is also a dropdown list of other options. <br><br>

            <p class="principles">PARC stands for Proximity, Alignment, Repetition, and Contrast.
            For Proximity: The user needs a visual cue on what items belong together. This is a 
            way for related items to be seen as one. <br><br> Joann Fabrics utilizes this law by 
            grouping similar items like yarns, fabrics, sales, regularly purchased items, and other
            options. In close proximity to each section are the buttons to shop those specific items. <br><br>

            <img src="images/nerdcrafty.jpg" alt="Nerdcrafty Homepage">
            <p class="principles"> The rule of thirds is grid of equally shapped imaginary blocks sized 3 X 3, 
                that makes the image visually appealing. This shows how the eye is viewing the image and helps
                a web-designer optimize their images. <br><br> The images on this site follow this rule very well.
                The top image has items on the left and right that are spaced out within the grid.
                As for the bottom image there are three soaps that are laid out in the bottom third of the image. <br><br>
